# TypeScript-Snippets

This is our collection of useful TypeScript snippets, which makes it a lot easier for us to develop in our Angular Projects.
In enterprise grade applications, everyone will encounter various problems which need to be solved to maintain a sustainable and extensible code base. In this collection you will find solutions to some of the problems we have encountered.


1. [Typed Id's](./tree/master/TypedIds)
Provides an interface which wraps the String type to give the TypeScript Compiler the ability to help the developer while handling Id's.

2. [Immutability](./tree/master/Immutability)
An immutable type, which provides deep immutability.


Hopefully we could also solve some of your problems or provide some new solution ideas.
We are always looking forward to your suggestions for improvement and comments on our snippets here at GitHub.
